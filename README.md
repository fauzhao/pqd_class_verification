# Power Quality Classification Assesment
Example study on Power Quality Disturbance Classification. Five periods of power signal is used for classification. S-transform (ST) is used for pre-processing of the signals. Distinctive features in the power signal are revelaed with ST. Then feautures are extracted from output of ST. Feed forward back propogation Neural Network is used for classification. In this sample application three types of Power Quality Distrubance (PQD) types are considered:

1. Normal
2. Sag
3. Harmonics

For each type of distrubance, 50 random signals according to signals models specified in the literature are generated.
